# ECB Key Interest Rates

[Shiny app](https://faebse.shinyapps.io/interest_rates/) that plots the European Central Bank's key interest rates over a chosen period of time. The graph reflects current trends because the  data are pulled from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/).  The interest rates are:

* The interest rate on the main refinancing operations, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system
* The rate on the deposit facility, which banks may use to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem
* The rate on the marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks from the Eurosystem
